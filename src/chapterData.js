Such measures shall seek construction of infrastructure; planning and regulation of the new settlements and their maintenance, improvement and growth; preservation and restoration of environmental balance; division of large rural estates; collective exploitation and organization of the farming cooperatives; development of the small rural property; stimulation of agriculture, livestock farming, forestry and other economic activities in rural communities; and to avoid destruction of natural resources and damages against property to the detriment of society.”`,

    description1: `The Nuevo Laredo/Laredo Border is the principal border crossing for produce exports between Mexico and the United States. The World Trade Bridge is where the majority of commercial trucks cross. This border crossing is regulated by extensive international, Mexican, and United States bodies. Notably, the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal Health and Plant Inspection Service (AHPIS) regulates the import of avocados across this border.

    description2: `The legislative foundation of AHPIS, including its capacity to inspect agricultural products, is established by the following pieces of legislation:

    description6: `For avocados to cross this border they must have received the Phytosanitary Certification through the Mexican government to meet US and World Trade Organisation (WTO) phytosanitary standards. Before they arrive at the border, an USMCA Certificate of Origin must be obtained to allow access to the US market. AHPIS officials inspect orchards and warehouses year-round in Michoacán and these enforcement activities are paid out of a fund controlled by The Association of Avocado Exporting Producers and Packers of Mexico (APEAM).

In June 2022, the Jalisco region was approved to export avocados to the US Market, leading to a reproduction of the industry expansion dynamics and impacts as has been seen in Michoacán.

    description3: `“The United States is concerned that workers at the Facility are being denied the right of free association and collective bargaining because the company has attempted to interfere with workers’ union activities and to dominate or control the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores y Empleados de la Industria del Comercio, Alimenticia, Textil, Automotriz, Metalúrgica, Servicios y Distribución Generalísimo José María Morelos y Pavón, a Mexican union, and the Confederación Central Nacional (COCENA), a Mexican union confederation.”
