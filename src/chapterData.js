      '"Land tenure and resource ownership are the legal precondition of the avocado industry in Michoacán. \n\n' +
      "Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution (1917) states: 'The property of all land and water within national territory is originally owned by the Nation, who has the right to transfer this ownership to particulars.' \n\n" +
      "Hence, private property is a privilege created by the Nation. This article entrenched ownership of natural resources in Mexico to the State. \n\n" +
      "Article 27 stipulates: 'appropriate measures shall be issued to put in order human settlements and to define adequate provisions, reserves and use of land, water and forest. Such measures shall seek construction of infrastructure; planning and regulation of the new settlements and their maintenance, improvement and growth; preservation and restoration of environmental balance; division of large rural estates; collective exploitation and organization of the farming cooperatives; development of the small rural property; stimulation of agriculture, livestock farming, forestry and other economic activities in rural communities; and to avoid destruction of natural resources and damages against property to the detriment of society.'\""
