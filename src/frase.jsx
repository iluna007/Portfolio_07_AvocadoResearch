        Legal and Bureaucratic Architecture of Avocado Industry “We Mexicans, at
        least here in Michoacán, have started to see it as normal. Obviously,
        that’s not right, it’s not right to see it as normal, but unfortunately,
        our authorities, our government, have done nothing. And I’m not just
        talking about this current government, I’m talking about previous
        governments. But sadly, in the government that just ended and the one
        we're in now, there’s more flexibility, like there’s a looser grip, and
        the only thing this is going to lead to is that things will get more
        difficult every day.” Interview with Bertha
