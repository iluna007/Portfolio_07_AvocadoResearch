      <strong>Description: </strong>
      <br />
      The legal context for the expansion of the Mexican avocado industry was
      the 1994 trade between agreement negotiated between Mexico, the US and
      Canada – the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement
      facilitated the massive expansion of the avocado industry in Michoacán.
      Michoacán was the only avocado producing region which was approved to
      export avocados to the US market.
      <br />
      <em>
        The US passed The Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act
        (2000) with the stated purpose to:{" "}
      </em>
      <br />
      <br />
      “authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided
      in this chapter, of an orderly procedure for the development and financing
      (through an adequate assessment on Hass avocados sold by producers and
      importers in the United States) of an effective and coordinated program of
      promotion, research, industry information, and consumer information,
      including funds for marketing and market research activities, that is
      designed to—
      <br />
      <em>
        (1) strengthen the position of the Hass avocado industry in the domestic
        marketplace; and
      </em>
      <br />
      <em>
        (2) maintain, develop, and expand markets and uses for Hass avocados in
        the domestic marketplace.”
